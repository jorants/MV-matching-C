This git repository used to contain an implementation of the **Micali Vazirani Maximum Cardinality Matching Algorithm**.

The code is currently in an early stage and although the algorithm is implemented and seems to work, it really isn't user friendly.

It may currently be used as a C library, and it is possible to make pictures of the algorithm as it progresses. There are currently no bugs or show-stoppers that we know of, though the library could still use several improvements.

Throughout January and February 2015:

1. The code will be cleaned-up and documented

2. There will be a nice program for the console, so that you may interface with the library properly.

3. The test suite will be improved

4. We will make a performance comparison with other implementations
