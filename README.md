Hi!

This git repository used to contain an implementation of the **Micali Vazirani Maximum Cardinality Matching Algorithm**.

The code is currently in an early stage and although the algorithm is implemented and seems to work, it really isn't user friendly.

This will be changed throughout January and February 2014, and some text will be added here to explain how the algorithm can be used. There will be a C library, a way of making pictures of the algorithm as it progresses (with the help of [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)) and maybe eventually some bindings for other programming languages.

To get the latest version of the code, you go to a terminal and do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jorants/MV-matching-C.git
```

And then, in the resulting folder:

```
$ make
```
