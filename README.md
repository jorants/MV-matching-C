This git repository used to contain an implementation of the **Micali Vazirani Maximum Cardinality Matching Algorithm**.

The code is currently in an early stage and although the algorithm is implemented and seems to work, it really isn't user friendly.

It may currently be used as a C library, and it is possible to make pictures of the algorithm as it progresses.

This will be changed further throughout January and February 2015; several optimizations are due, and there is currently a rare bug which needs to be tracked down (so this is unusable for prodution purposes at the moment).
